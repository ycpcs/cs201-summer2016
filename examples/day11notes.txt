Using collections:
  Whereever possible, use collections *interfaces*, not
  *classes*

     - use classes when creating objects (instances of
       concrete collection types, e.g., ArrayList)

     - all other uses (parameter types, field types,
       variable types) use an interface (e.g., List)
